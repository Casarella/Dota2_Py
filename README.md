# Dota2_Py

Dota2_Py is designed to achieve some quick statistical analysis and rough modeling on the Dota 2 International Prizepool for each year.

Since 2014, the total prizepool for the tournament has been 'crowdfunded' (supplemented) by community purchases of in-game items such as the ticket(s) to the event itself and other cosmetics sold as 'Treasures'/'Caches'. Each year, the base prizepool starts at 1.6M USD and 25% of all sales go towards funding the prizepool.
